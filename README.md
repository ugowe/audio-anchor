# AudioAnchor
A music player created with AVPlayer

This single-view app retrieves a list of song snippets from a server and presents them to the user for playback.

Each cell displays the song title, while the currently playing cell also contains a play/pause image that corresponds to player's status.

When pressing play on a cell, the song plays, and any other audio stops playing. When the song finishes playing, the next song in the table auto-play.
